# My Bootcamp Projects
Here you will find some of the tasks I completed as part of the Full Stack Web Development Bootcamp.

## Async and await - randomGIF.js
- The main aim of this task was to fetch data from the Cat API using the async and await function.
- Then only output the image URL in the console URL

## REACT elements and components - react-clone
- The aim of this task was to recreate a single webpage of your choice and introduced REACT elements and functional components
- External libraries were also integrated for styling purposes.
- Note: single-webpage creation only, therefore limited interactivity (i.e. links, hover-over).

## REACT Local State Management and Events - react-interest-calculator
- The aim of this task was to create an interest calculator web page with React and JSX, simulating
  a fictional banking app that allows the user to deposit, withdraw and calculate fees or interest.
- The task focus was on implementing shared state between two separate components and then lifting to a parent component.
- Note: App focus on functionalities rather than design.
