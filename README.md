# My Bootcamp Projects
Here you will find some of the tasks I completed as part of the Full Stack Web Development Bootcamp.

## Async and await - randomGIF.js
- The main aim of this task was to fetch data from the Cat API using the async and await function.
- Then only output the image URL in the console URL

## REACT elements and components - react-clone
- The aim of this task was to recreate a single webpage of your choice and introduced REACT elements and functional components
- External libraries were also integrated for styling purposes.
- Note: single-webpage creation only, therefore limited interactivity (i.e. links, hover-over).

#### Follow these instructions for the REACT application ðŸš¦:

1. **Save the React folder** to your local machine and navigate to the root folder of the REACT app.
2. **Run 'npm install'** command in the terminal/command line to install the relevant app dependencies.
3. **Run 'npm start'** command in the terminal /command line to start the development server
4. **You can now view the app in the browser**ðŸŽ‰
