      It’s been 15 years since the first flavour-packed graze box landed on a doorstep and our 
      hunger for innovation is still just as insatiable as it was that day in 2008. Inventive 
      flavours. A benefit (or two). Simple, wholesome ingredients. This 4-punnet box became our legacy, and it’s 
      one we’re extremely proud of.

      <p className="p2">​
      And now, graze Presents... a new era of snacking. A different collection every month. Limited edition
      snacks you've never seen before. All curated by our taste experts.
      ​</p>
      <p className="p3">
      All to help you eat a little bit better, live a smidge more sustainably, with snacks that make it a touch
      easier. ​Because it’s the little (sn)actions that can add up to big change.
